# ReadMe for COMP 15 HW6
## Song Search 

### Purpose

The purpose of the assignment is to implement a search on a large song database.
In this search, we use a hash table and vectors of Song classes.

A hash table of all words ever used in every song will hold a vector of the top
ten songs to have that word (ranked by usage of that word in the song). For
context, each of the instances of a word in a song will also have indices in the
lyric array. This way, we can easily get -5 and +5 words (from either side).

While reading in words, a vector of songs to use each word will update and
truncate in order to only keep the top 10.
